# MoveU

Moveu is a GVS(Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation) device for electrically stimulating the vestibular nerve and simulating sensation of movement. This repo is the base developmental version of the project https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/move-u/overview/ which was developed at the Fluid Interfaces Group at the MIT Media Lab. 

## Hardware
The schematic and layout files are included and can be edited using Altium designer. The generated Gerber files are attached and are supported by OshPark/Other Fabs for fabrication. 

## Software
The bootloader and firmware can be flashed onto the BC832 using a JLINK and a FTDI cable by Arduino IDE. Libraries and Bootloader are available in the IDE.
