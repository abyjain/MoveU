Change Log
==========
Version 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT
* Added possibility to change default operation timeout (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/pull/321)
* Fixed Dagger2 compatibility (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/pull/342 https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/pull/348)
* Fixed DisconnectionRouter leaking subscription to RxBleAdapterStateObservable (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/pull/353)
* Improved Location Services status check (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/issues/327)
* Added logger that prints out GATT server structure on a successful discovery. The log is generated when the logger is in a VERBOSE level (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/pull/355)
* Enchanced operation logger so it displays how long the operation performed. (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/pull/356)

Version 1.4.3
* Log informing that the underlying semaphore in a QueueSemaphore has been interrupted will be printed only when the situation was unexpected.(https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/issues/317)
* Fixed possible race condition when calling `.doOnSubscribe()` and `.doOnUnsubscribe()` which lead to calling `ConnectionOperationQueueImpl.onConnectionUnsubscribed()` before the `.onConnectionSubscribed()` has returned. (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/issues/308)
* Updated RxJava dependency (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/issues/312)
* Updated to Gradle 3.0.0/Android Studio 3.0 (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/issues/302)

Version 1.4.2
* Fixed MTU value not being updated when changed by the peripheral (https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle/issues/293)
